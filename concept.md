Project: Policy Proof

A Causal Inference Engine for Climate PolicyThe Elevator PitchPolicy Proof is a web-based tool that uses AI and a quasi-experimental statistical method called Spatial Regression Discontinuity to measure the true causal impact of local climate policies, enabling funders like MassCEC to make evidence-based investment decisions.The ProblemPolicymakers and grant funders invest millions in local climate initiatives—like EV charging subsidies, home weatherization rebates, or gas-leaf-blower bans—but they face a critical challenge: proving causation.Did a subsidy in Cambridge cause an increase in solar panel adoption, or did it just happen in a wealthy, environmentally-conscious area that would have adopted them anyway? It's nearly impossible to separate a policy's true effect from simple correlation with a town's demographics. Without clear proof of impact, funds can be wasted on ineffective strategies.Our Solution: "Policy Proof"Policy Proof solves this by treating municipal borders as the dividing line in a natural experiment. By comparing data from just inside a town's border with data from just outside, we can isolate and measure the policy's real-world effect.Our platform will allow a user to draw a boundary on a map, specify the policy in question, and automatically receive a clear, data-driven "Impact Score" that shows if the policy actually works.How It Works: The 4-Step AnalysisDefine the Boundary & Policy: A user (e.g., a MassCEC analyst) uses an interactive map to select a municipal boundary (e.g., Newton vs. Needham). They then specify the policy being evaluated (e.g., "Newton's Residential Heat Pump Subsidy Program").Automated Data Aggregation (The AI): Our backend automatically scrapes publicly available data relevant to the outcome. This could include:Electrical or building permit databases for heat pump/solar installations.Satellite imagery processed to count rooftop solar panels or identify green spaces.EV registration data from the RMV.Spatial Regression Discontinuity (The "Magic"): The core of our analysis. The tool measures the density of the outcome variable (e.g., heat pump installations per 1000 homes) as a function of distance from the border.Visualize the Impact: The result is a simple, powerful chart. If the policy is effective, we will see a sharp, statistically significant "jump" or discontinuity in the data right at the border. This jump represents the causal effect of the policy.Hackathon Tech StackBackend: Python (FastAPI) to handle API requests, run the analysis, and manage data scraping.Geospatial Analysis: GeoPandas and Shapely to process geographic data and calculate distances from the border.Frontend: JavaScript with Leaflet.js or Mapbox for an interactive map interface.Data Visualization: D3.js or Chart.js to render the final discontinuity plot.Deployment: Docker for easy packaging.Hackathon Goals (What We'll Build This Weekend)MVP Backend: A FastAPI server that accepts a GeoJSON boundary and can run a simulated Spatial RD analysis on pre-loaded mock data.Interactive Frontend: A simple web page with a map where a user can see a pre-defined boundary (e.g., Brookline/Boston).End-to-End Demo: A complete, working example for one policy, such as "Does Brookline's ban on gas leaf blowers lead to a higher density of electric landscapers operating near its border?"The Pitch-Ready Visualization: The final, compelling graph showing the policy's impact.Pitch for MassCEC"MassCEC's goal is to fund climate technologies and policies that build resilience. But 'viability' depends on proof, and proof is hard to come by. Policy Proof provides that evidence. By applying a rigorous, Nobel-prize-winning statistical framework, our tool moves beyond correlation to demonstrate causation. Using our platform, you can assess the real-world impact of existing policies to guide your future funding, ensuring every dollar is invested in strategies that are proven to work."
